This project will require you to make "auth-reddit" and "auth-ai" (csv) files in the /src directory. These will include your api keys login information. 

auth-ai (at least if you use openrouter) only requires one api key to be pasted into it.

auth-reddit requires (in order): client_id, client_secret, user_agent, username, password

Dependencies: python3--full

dependencies and virtual environment is handled automatically, but if you run into probems, try installing "praw" and "openai" libraries

I used openRouter for this project personally, which gave me the ability to switch between free (but terrible) models, and paid ones. I personally recommend doing this.
