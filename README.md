This project will require you to make "auth-reddit" and "auth-ai" (csv) files in their respective directories. These will include your api keys login information. 

This project is currently set up to display responses only in the terminal, rather than posting them.

I used openRouter for this project personally, which gave me the ability to switch between free (terrible) models, and paid ones. The reddit API is relatively simpler to set up, and can be done using reddit's app creation online tool.
